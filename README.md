# Music-Player

# Overview
This music player is a simple web-based application that allows you to play, pause, and switch between a set of songs. It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and has a user-friendly interface that displays album art, song titles, and artists. The music player also features a progress bar that updates in real-time and allows the user to click anywhere on the bar to jump to a specific point in the song.

# Structure
The project consists of three main files:

1. index.html: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the music player, including the play/pause button, next/previous song buttons, 
and areas to display the song title, artist, album art, and progress bar.

2. style.css: This is the CSS file that handles all of the styling for the music player, including positioning, color schemes, 
and responsive design for different screen sizes.

3. script.js: This is the JavaScript file that provides the functionality of the music player. It allows for the playing and pausing of songs,
switching to the next or previous song, updating the progress bar, and switching songs by clicking on the progress bar.

# Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the project files.
3. Open the index.html file in your browser.

# Usage
Once the index.html file is open in your browser, you can interact with the music player:

1. Click on the play/pause button to start or stop the music.
2. Click on the next or previous song buttons to switch songs.
3. Click anywhere on the progress bar to jump to a specific point in the song.

# Note
The songs used in this project are hard-coded into the JavaScript file for simplicity, 
but the code can easily be modified to dynamically load songs from a server or user input.
